1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") for styling. It will contain DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and scripting purposes.

2. "styles.css": This is the custom CSS file for the website. It will contain styles that are not covered by Tailwind CSS. It will use the id names of the DOM elements defined in "index.html" to apply styles.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file. It's a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. It will also use the id names of the DOM elements defined in "index.html" to apply styles.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements within the "index.html" file. Both "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" will use these IDs to apply specific styles to these elements.

2. CSS Classes: These are shared between "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css". They are used to apply styles to HTML elements. Tailwind CSS classes will be used in the HTML file and can be overridden in "styles.css" if needed.

3. CSS Selectors: These are shared between "styles.css" and "tailwind.css". They are used to select and manipulate HTML elements based on their id, class, type, attribute etc.

4. Media Queries: These are used in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" to make the website responsive. They apply different styles for different browser and device sizes.

5. HTML Tags: These are used in "index.html" and are styled in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css". They define the structure and content of the web content.

6. Link Tags: These are used in "index.html" to link the CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") to the HTML file.
